One of the ways to optimize the matching algorithm is to use machine learning.
Deep learning is a part of machine learning that basically involves the use of neural networks.
Convolutional neural network is a neural network model that is good for image recognition processes.
This program will teach itself the types of different clothing types by giving them datasets.
This is called supervised learning where the program is given a data set that has labels on each image.
The convolutional network will then try to classify these different types of clothing types.
The goal of the program is to be able to recognize these clothing types and detect it by the webcam.
This program is just for practice, by making a simple CNN so that later can be applied to star tracking applications.
Hopefully this program will give me an experience of making a deep learning model, especially recognizing objects live on camera.
Because later in the star tracking process, it will be used to generate live attitude data of the satellite.
