So this program tries to find an image from inside a folder containing a catalogue of images that matches a test image.
Since my thesis is dealing about star tracker which essentially involves finding matches also in the star tracker I decided to make this little program.
The test image is can be found in this folder called croppedstar.img
The catalogue is every image inside the folder "Random Stars"
